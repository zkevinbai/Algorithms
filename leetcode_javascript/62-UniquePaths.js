A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Example 1:


Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28
Example 2:

Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down
Example 3:

Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
Example 4:

Input: m = 3, n = 3
Output: 6


Constraints:

1 <= m, n <= 100
It's guaranteed that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.

dynamic programming solution

build the board one square at a time
moving left to right, top from down
memoize the potential unique paths of each square 
use addition to get the total uniques

solution
m = height of box
n = width of box

starting position is always (0, 0)
DFS to get all possible paths

increment path count each time there is a solution;
