21 March 2025 Friday

1. **Valid Parentheses**  
   - **Problem**: Check if a string containing parentheses is valid (closed in the correct order).  
   - **Solution**: Used a stack to track opening parentheses and match them with closing ones.

2. **Min Stack**  
   - **Problem**: Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element.  
   - **Solution**: Used a secondary stack to track the minimum elements at each stage.

3. **Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation**  
   - **Problem**: Evaluate a mathematical expression in Reverse Polish Notation.  
   - **Solution**: Used a stack to process operands and operators, calculating intermediate results.

4. **Generate Parentheses**  
   - **Problem**: Generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses for a given number of pairs.  
   - **Solution**: Applied backtracking, ensuring open and close counts never exceed the limit.

5. **Car Fleet**  
   - **Problem**: Determine how many car fleets will reach a target destination based on their starting positions and speeds.  
   - **Solution**: Used a stack to track times for each car to reach the target and group cars into fleets.

6. **Largest Rectangle in Histogram**  
   - **Problem**: Find the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed in a histogram.  
   - **Solution**: Used a stack to calculate the largest rectangle by processing bars from left to right, calculating width and height dynamically.

7. **Daily Temperatures**  
   - **Problem**: For each day, determine how many days you must wait until a warmer temperature.  
   - **Solution**: Used a stack to track the indices of temperatures, popping elements when a warmer temperature is found and calculating the number of days to wait.
