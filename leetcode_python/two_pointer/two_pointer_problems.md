## **Two Pointer Problems Completed**

1. **Valid Palindrome**  
   - **Problem**: Determine if a given string is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring case.  
   - **Solution**: Used two pointers, one starting from the beginning and one from the end, moving toward the center while ignoring non-alphanumeric characters and comparing characters case-insensitively.

2. **Two Sum II - Input Array is Sorted**  
   - **Problem**: Find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target from a sorted array.  
   - **Solution**: Applied the two-pointer approach to efficiently find the two numbers that sum up to the target by moving the pointers inward based on whether the current sum is less than or greater than the target.

3. **3Sum**  
   - **Problem**: Find all unique triplets in an array that sum to a target value.  
   - **Solution**: Used sorting and a two-pointer approach to find all unique triplets by iterating over each element and applying the two-pointer technique to find pairs that sum to the target minus the current element.

4. **Container with Most Water**  
   - **Problem**: Find the maximum area that can be contained between two lines in a 2D plane.  
   - **Solution**: Used the two-pointer approach to find the maximum area by calculating the area between the lines at the left and right pointers and then moving the pointer pointing to the shorter line toward the center to maximize the area.

5. **Trapping Rain Water**  
   - **Problem**: Calculate the amount of water that can be trapped between the bars in a given elevation map.  
   - **Solution**: Used a two-pointer approach to traverse the array, maintaining the maximum heights encountered from both sides, and calculated the trapped water based on the difference between the current height and the minimum of the two max heights.
