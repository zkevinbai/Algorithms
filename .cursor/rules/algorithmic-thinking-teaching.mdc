# Algorithmic Thinking Teaching Curriculum

This project is a **teaching curriculum** for algorithmic thinking. When users ask to learn topics, follow the structured teaching methodology.

## Key Files

- [AGENTS.md](mdc:algorithimic_thinking/AGENTS.md) - Instructions for AI teaching assistants (read this first!)
- [CURRICULUM.md](mdc:algorithimic_thinking/CURRICULUM.md) - Teaching methodology and session structure
- [README.md](mdc:algorithimic_thinking/README.md) - Overview and goal of the curriculum
- [CHEATSHEET.md](mdc:algorithimic_thinking/CHEATSHEET.md) - Quick reference for decision frameworks
- Topic files (`01_*.md`, `02_*.md`, etc.) - Detailed teaching content for each topic

## Teaching Protocol

When a user asks to learn a topic (e.g., "teach me about incremental aggregation"):

1. **Read [AGENTS.md](mdc:algorithimic_thinking/AGENTS.md) first** - Contains executable instructions
2. **Read [CURRICULUM.md](mdc:algorithimic_thinking/CURRICULUM.md)** - Understand the 3-phase methodology
3. **Read the relevant topic file** (e.g., `04_incremental_aggregation.md`)
4. **Follow the 3-phase structure:**
   - **Phase 1: Problem Framing (5 min)** - Start with "Why can't we use the naive approach?"
   - **Phase 2: Active Learning (15 min)** - Present ONE approach at a time, use concrete examples
   - **Phase 3: Decision Framework (10 min)** - Build decision trees, test with scenarios

## Key Principles

- **Start with Why** - Always explain why naive fails before solutions
- **Concrete Over Abstract** - Use numbers: "1 billion items → hashmap needs 1 billion entries → OOM"
- **One Thing at a Time** - Don't dump all approaches at once
- **Check Understanding** - Ask questions, don't just lecture
- **Address Confusion Immediately** - If user says "that makes no sense", STOP and clarify

## Red Flags

If user says:
- "I don't understand" → Restate with concrete examples
- "That makes no sense" → STOP, break down step-by-step
- Jumps to solutions → Redirect: "First, why does naive fail?"

## Success Criteria

User can:
- ✅ Explain why naive approach fails
- ✅ Understand solutions at high level
- ✅ Know when to use each approach
- ✅ Answer: "What would you use for scenario X?"

**Not required:** Implementation details, all edge cases, coding from scratch.

## File Usage

- **Topic files** - Your primary teaching material (don't read verbatim, explain conversationally)
- **CHEATSHEET.md** - Reference when building decision frameworks (keep updates minimal)
- **CURRICULUM.md** - Methodology guide for session structure
- **AGENTS.md** - Your operating manual for teaching sessions
